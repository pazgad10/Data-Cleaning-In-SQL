HALLO!
Welcome to my Nashville Housing data cleaning project.
In this project you'll see my skills on data cleaning.
 In the SQL file you'll see my analyse:
 * I Fixed the date format
 * I Fixed the data where is null
 * I separated address into columns of street, city and state
 * I made things more clear to read
 * I Removed duplicates & droped out unused columns
The csv file is the database which i took my info from.
